## 🔐 SECURITY MODEL

### Multi-Tenant Isolation
```
Institute A        Institute B
    ↓                  ↓
  Cohort 1          Cohort 3
  Cohort 2          Cohort 4
    ↓                  ↓
Students A1-10    Students B1-10
    ↓                  ↓
Data (RLS)        Data (RLS)
    ↓                  ↓
No Access         No Access
```

### RLS Enforcement
- Every table has row-level security
- Institute filter on all queries
- Cohort filter on all queries
- User filter on all queries
- Database enforces (not code)
